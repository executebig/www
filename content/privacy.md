We hope this privacy disclosure can give you some clarity with how we handle your personal information.

## Tracking & Data Collection

### Tracking

We use the open source Plausible Analytics routed through our stats subdomain to count website visits, downloads, etc. You can see the same data we can see on the public dashboard. No cookies are used and no personal data—not even an IP address or browser user agent—is stored. For more information, see the [Plausible Data Policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

In order to better understand how our visitors have been using our website, we use [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com) to collect information like
how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, etc., and this enables us to continue improving
our website's accessibility.

Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address 
(processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser 
information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information 
on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.

We use Segment to send data from our application and website listed on this page to some third parties listed on this page. 
You can read Segment's privacy policy at https://segment.com/legal/privacy/. We collect most data for research purposes – these information
will be deleted as soon as we finish processing them. 

### hCaptcha

We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. 

For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: https://hcaptcha.com/privacy and https://hcaptcha.com/terms.
