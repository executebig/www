## Tracking & Data Collection

### Tracking

We use the open source Plausible Analytics routed through our stats subdomain to count website visits, downloads, etc. You can see the same data we can see on the public dashboard. No cookies are used and no personal data—not even an IP address or browser user agent—is stored. For more information, see the [Plausible Data Policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

In order to better understand how our visitors have been using our website, we use [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com) to collect information like
how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, etc., and this enables us to continue improving
our website's accessibility.

Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address 
(processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser 
information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information 
on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.

We use Segment to send data from our application and website listed on this page to some third parties listed on this page. 
You can read Segment's privacy policy at https://segment.com/legal/privacy/. We collect most data for research purposes – these information
