Execute Big is a non-profit organization that strongly believes your right to privacy, especially given we work with students on a regular basis. We only ask for your information when we actually need it, and we are very careful when handling data.

We hope this privacy disclosure can give you some clarity with how we handle your personal information.

## Tracking & Data Collection

To get information about the behavior of our visitors, we use
[Umami](https://umami.is/). Our instance of Umami is deployed and shown as **`umami.executebig.org`**,
and all information collected by Umami is stored on our own servers.

This analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general. Umami does not collect any personally 
identifiable information and anonymizes all data collected. Users cannot be identified and are never tracked across websites. 
Umami does not use any cookies in the tracking code, either.
