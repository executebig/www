We have chosen to sunset our advising program. Running an event during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is very different from
what it was before, and we encourage organizers to find the appropriate resources that would benefit their own events the most.

In the meantime, you are always welcome to reach out to us via [email](/contact) for questions. We have also open-sourced most 
of our organizing material for [Hack Chicago 2018](https://hackchicago.io), which you can always refer to as an additional resource
during your event-planning process.

Thank you for your interest!
