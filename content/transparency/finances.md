We believe it is incredibly important for a non-profit organization to keep everything transparent. We are committed to making sure your support can create maximum impact for students in need. To achieve that, we have built an easy-to-use finance data dashboard so we can easily share our income and expenditure data with the public.

Our banking infrastructure is provided by [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), a bank built for startups.
