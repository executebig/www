Every line of code that we write to power our software and automation is open-source on GitHub. You'll be able to inspect them, 
help improve them, or even reuse them for your own projects. 

We deploy everything on _Elf_, our own [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) server, a grant from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)'s Hub for Good. It functions like any other PaaS (e.g. Heroku), but most of our data lives in our own server. 

If you need assistence redeploying our projects, please feel free to [reach out](/contact)!
