Hack Chicago was a 24-hour high school hackathon that took place in July, 2018. With over $25,000 in cash sponsorship, 250 students in attendance, 40 projects created, it was the Midwest's largest high school hackathon. 

**This is a documentation of how Hack Chicago was put together.** It includes dozens of stories, resources, and tips — some exclusive to Hack Chicago as an event, others might be helpful for all new hackathon organizers. We hope that this can be a helpful resource to help more high school students run fun, impactful and high quality events in areas where events like hackathons are not as popular. 

**All information included in the archives are 100% real.** In some places, we might have redacted out some information for security and privacy purposes, but most of the documents, conversations logs, and finances are completely authentic — they made Hack Chicago happen.
