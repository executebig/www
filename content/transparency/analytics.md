To get information about the behavior of our visitors, we use [Umami](https://umami.is/). Thanks to the
software itself, we are able to make our analytics data public. Umami may be set up at different times
for different services, therefore you will likely see data from only after that initial setup date.

Please refer to our [Privacy](/privacy#tracking--data-collection) page for information on how we collect visitor insights.
