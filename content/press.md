## About Execute Big

Execute Big is a minimal & transparent student-run nonprofit organization founded to enable all students, with a focus on underrepresented demographics, to experience and explore computer science education.

Founded in 2019 by Megan Cui, Mingjie Jiang and Sean Kim, Execute Big is filling a niche in the technology industry that has been overlooked by giant companies and individuals alike. We work with institutions, educators, and other organizations to build programs and provide scholarship funds in order to make CS education more accessible for any student, regardless of their gender, race, geographic location, or socioeconomic status.
