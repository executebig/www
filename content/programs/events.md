We've organized innovative, purpose-driven events impacting thousands of students. Now, we help private institutions like yours to start your own.

<!-- Announcement Block -->
{{< announcement content="<p class='title'>COVID-19 Response</p>Due to public health concerns, our in-person events have been suspended until the COVID-19 emergency ends.

## We know what it takes to build a stellar innovation program from ground up.

As high schoolers, we were lucky enough to experience the magic of hackathons. We went on to run our own programs for our communities, build platforms for our schools, blog profusely about our stories, and share similar stories on a national stage.

We want to work with you to give your students a story of their own to tell.

## We create impact.

Our events have reached 1,000+ students across the country.

## FAQ

### What's the cost?
For each event, we charge a set amount to reimburse our team of event organizers and to support the growth of Execute Big as an organization. Part of your payment will be tax-deductible.

### What is “hacking”?
No, we’re not “hacking” servers or databases. The word is being constructively re-defined as building things—apps, games, websites, etc.

### How are we non-profit?
Execute Big is a non-profit organization. The team only receives a fair compensation for their contribution, and the rest is passed on as a donation to the organization.

### Got more questions?
We're more than happy to help out. We can be reached via email at team@executebig.org. You can schedule a call with us when you are next available via email as well.
