A free, selective advising resource supporting talented student hackathon organizers all around the world. By students, for students.

## We want to help.

Organizing hackathons can be hard. With so many moving parts, it’s an experience that’s rewarding but nonetheless grueling. Sometimes, you just need an extra set of eyes on your email template or a chat to refresh your marketing strategies, but it can be hard to find people with the expertise and time to help you out.

With years of hackathon organizing experience, we want to help making your event possible.

## Any event. Every organizer.

Execute Big’s new Organizer Advising program is a free, application-based advising resource supporting talented student hackathon organizers all around the world. We help student organizers by editing marketing & sponsorship emails, as well as providing 20-minute brainstorming sessions to help you talk over anything you want.

## Prioritization & Contribution

We prioritize applications from events that commit to donating to Execute Big. Funds directly support the [Travel Grant](/programs/grant) program. Suggested contribution: $50. Events who utilize our resource are expected to promote Execute Big on their website and marketing material.

## Let's accomplish more, together. 

We can't wait to work with you and your team to create the best event for your local community.
