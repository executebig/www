## FAQs

### Who runs the Fellowship?

Execute Big Fellowship is run by Execute Big, a non-profit organization dedicated to making computer science education accessible for everyone. The Fellowship will be
facilitated by the co-founders of the organization: Megan Cui (Harvard '2?) and Mingjie Jiang (UC Berkeley '24). You can read about their profiles [here Â»](/team).

### Who can apply?

Execute Big Fellowship is aimed at students currently attending 8th to 11th grade of high school. Students with a teacher's recommendation letter will be prioritized.

### How much does the Fellowship cost?

We have decided to price the program at $300 per student. However, we expect that we will be giving out full, need-based scholarship for the majority of our student fellows
to support their growth. For this reason, students will be surveyed about their financial need on the application.
