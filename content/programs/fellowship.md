Execute Big Fellowship is a six-week virtual program to introduce beginner students to the interdisciplinary world of computer science.

Our introductory program places an emphasis on learning about technology at work rather than traditional computer programming course experience. With a highly-personalized, interactive educational model, cohorts will leave with a nuanced understanding of the industry, professional mentorship, and a technical computer programming background to seal the deal.

## Explore First

A career in technology seems synonymous with a computer programming desk job, but it doesn't have to be. By facilitating experiences with many different industries and opportunities, we enable our fellows to take back the power to dictate their future and explore first.

## Personalized for Every Fellow

At Execute Big, our core philosophy postulates that every single student deserves the chance to discover their spark. Computer science is an exciting, powerful field, but it is also one that is often inaccessible to students from demographically underprivileged backgrounds. We believe that a student shouldn't experience less simply because they don't live in a region with bountiful tech opportunities or attend a school with computer science classes. Our fellowship gives these students an opportunity they might not otherwise have to discover a spark for computer science.

## A Chance for Everyone

A computer science education is hard to come by, and it can make technology seem like a far-away universe to students who don't have access to computer science experiences. So, we shape this fellowship around these students, providing nuanced computer science curriculum and enabling students to acquire both professional and technical know-how for their future.

## FAQs

### Who runs the Fellowship?

The Fellowship is run by Execute Big, a non-profit organization dedicated to making computer science education accessible for everyone. It will be
facilitated by the co-founders of the organization: Megan Cui (Harvard '23) and Mingjie Jiang (UC Berkeley '24). You can check out their profiles [here »](/team).

### Who can apply?

Execute Big Fellowship is aimed at students currently attending **9th to 11th grade of high school**. At this time, we are only able to accept students attending school in the United States, and students will need to receive a nomination from a teacher to apply. If you are unable to find a teacher sponsor but are still interested in applying, please email [fellowship@executebig.org](mailto:fellowship@executebig.org).

### How do students apply?

We require that every student receive a nomination from a teacher to apply. After the teacher nominates them, they will receive an invitation to submit an application within 24 hours. The application will not require any technical knowledge or experience to complete &mdash; we are more interested in learning about the student's creativity and character through the application process.

### How many students will you select?

We will admit around 15 students for the current cohort. We keep our cohorts small in order to allow us to better personalize the program for our students.

### How much does it cost?

The Fellowship is completely free for students during the pilot. Execute Big is funded by donors and sponsors &mdash; you can donate to us [here »](/donate).

### Can I apply if I don't know how to code?

Absolutely! The Fellowship will be 100% personalized for the background and skill level of the current cohort of students, so no prior experience is required to apply.

### I have more questions!

We’re more than happy to help out. Please send an email to [fellowship@executebig.org](mailto:fellowship@executebig.org), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
