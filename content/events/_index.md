We've organized innovative, purpose-driven events impacting thousands of students. Now, we help private institutions like yours to start your own.

## We know what it takes to build a stellar innovation program from ground up.

As high schoolers, we were lucky enough to experience the magic of hackathons. We went on to run our own programs for our communities, build platforms for our schools, blog profusely about our stories, and share similar stories on a national stage.

We want to work with you to give your students a story of their own to tell.

## We create impact.

Our events have reached 1,000+ students across the country.

## Hear what educators have to say...

Execute Big lived up to the promise of their name. They bolstered the reputation of Gilmour Academy as a technology leader. They turned a corner of our campus into a safe, welcoming space crackling with the electricity of student creativity. The white-glove service in preparing the event, from security to snacks, put our administration at ease. The contacts they developed around our community have built lasting partnerships for the school. **Execute Big has the playbook for inspiring makers.**

When we made the decision to host a hackathon at McDonogh, we quickly realized we didn’t have the knowledge or experience to host a meaningful event. Thankfully we had a connection to Megan, Sean, and Mingjie who were willing to help us take our idea and make it a reality... **Their experience helped us know exactly what to do and when we should have everything lined up in time for the event to run smoothly.** They thought of everything from the hourly agenda and snacks, to professional judges and marketing, and they were present for the full 24 hour hackathon and made sure that every student felt comfortable and supported. The event was a huge success thanks to the team and we could not have done it without them.

{{< expand "What is “hacking”?" >}}
No, we’re not “hacking” servers or databases. The word is being constructively re-defined as building things—apps, games, websites, etc.

{{< expand "How are we nonprofit?" >}}
Execute Big is a nonprofit organization. The team only receives a fair compensation for their contribution, and the rest is passed on as a donation to the organization.
