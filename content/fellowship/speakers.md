Every week, we will have the pleasure to welcome amazing speakers from the tech industry for a guest lecture or Q&A session as in intro to this week's topic. Students will have the opportunity to chat with our speakers, ask questions, and even establish long-term connections for mentorship.

> Speakers for Cohort 1 will be announced soon!
