The curriculum only includes the technical portion of the program -- our speakers and the topics that they cover are going to be announced closer to the program. It is also tentative -- we may modify these as we continue to improve our material.

Each "week" spans from Friday to the following Thursday in order to help us organize our guest sessions.
