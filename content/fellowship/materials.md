## Participation

As a virtual fellowship, we do our best to make sure that our programs are as interactive as possible. Therefore, we require that our
students attend every synchronous session. There will be a number of sessions during the program that are recorded - these activities
may be accessed asynchronously. 

## Technology

A computer with internet access is required to participate in the activities (Chromebooks allowed). A webcam is also recommended.
If a student is unable to access tech equipments or stable internet on a daily basis, please let us know -- we may be able to provide help. 

## Network Access

Please make sure the following websites and services are accessible within the network environment of the student, since
we will be conducting activities through them:
