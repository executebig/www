Anyone can audit Fellowship to help improving the program.

## Why Audit?

Auditing Fellowship will grant you access to all materials made available to our accepted fellows, which include:

* Workshop Recordings
* Speaker Session Recordings
* Workshop Curriculum Guides/Slides

Additionally, since Fellowship is still in the early stages of development, weâ€™re always looking for feedback to our 
curriculum or program logistics, and we'd be happy to chat with you about improving the program.

## Privacy

Due to student privacy concerns, we are unable to share all of our recorded materials publicly. If you are 
interested in auditing Fellowship, please email fellowship@executebig.org.
