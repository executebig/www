Anyone can audit Fellowship to help improving the program.

## Why Audit?

Auditing Fellowship will grant you access to all materials made available to our accepted fellows, which include:

* Workshop Recordings
* Speaker Session Recordings
* Workshop Curriculum Guides/Slides

Additionally, since Fellowship is still in the early stages of development, we’re always looking for feedback to our 
curriculum or program logistics, and we'd be happy to chat with you about improving the program.

## Privacy

Due to student privacy concerns, we are unable to share our all of our recorded materials publicly. If you are 
interested in auditing Fellowship, please email fellowship@executebig.org.
